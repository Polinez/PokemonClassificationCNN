# Pokémon Classification Using CNN
This project involves building and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images of 10 Pokémon species. The solution utilizes a ResNet50-based architecture and explores multiple techniques, including transfer learning, data augmentation, and normalization, to improve accuracy.

Key insights include:

- Achieved a validation accuracy of 84.82% using transfer learning.

- Experimented with different GPUs, CPUs, and architectures (e.g., InceptionV3, VGG16).

- Assessed the impact of hyperparameters such as batch size and image dimensions on performance.

- Tested the system under various configurations to optimize results and reduce overfitting.
